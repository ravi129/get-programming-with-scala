# Get Programming with Scala
Code, exercises, and answers for the book [Get Programming with Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-scala?a_aid=daniela&a_bid=7cd2421c).

Lessons are grouped per unit. Each lesson is a standalone SBT project and
it has the following three packages: `listings`, `quickchecks`, `trythis`.

Have a look at the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for links to all the available lessons.

## Installation Requirements
Make sure the following tools are installed:
 - JDK 8+
 - SBT

## Running the Code

### Code Snippets (Scala Worksheets)
Some lessons are simple snippets (files with extension \*.sc) also called Scala Worksheets.
They can be interpreted interactively from the REPL by IDEs with dedicated Scala support,
such as IntelliJ IDEA and ScalaIDE.

If you a using a text editor or your IDE doesn't support Scala Worksheets,
start the REPL from SBT:
```
sbt console
```

and evaluate the file as follows:
```
> :load /path/to/file.sc
```

### Executable SBT Programs
Some lessons are fully fleshed-out programs (files with extension \*.scala):
in order to run them, they need to be compiled.
First, navigate to the folder of the lesson you are interested in.

Suppose you want to review the code for lesson 8:
```
cd unit1/lesson8
```

Start SBT:
```
sbt
```

Compile and run the code:
```
> run
```

If a lecture isn't an executable program, please see section on running Scala Worksheets.
